## School District Analysis

#### Tools: Python, pandas, Jupyter Notebook
The following analysis seeks to explore the standardized test results and fiscal data for a school district.


#### Summary

A bird's eye view of the school district dataset- as outlined in the first part of of the analysis- shows us that
a total of 15 schools with a grand student body count of 39,170 were evaluated. In macro, the average reading score among this district's
was slightly higher than their average math scores, 78.99 and 81.88 respectively. Oddly however, the percentage of students who
are passing math is significantly higher by ~10%. Another finding that was particularly unexpected was that higher school spending 
correlated with lower overall passing percentages, according to this dataset. Unsurprisingly though, schools with
small (<1000) to medium (1000-2000) student bodies performed better overall compared to their larger counterparts (2000-5000 students),
likely due to the greater academic attention each student recieves in smaller classes.
